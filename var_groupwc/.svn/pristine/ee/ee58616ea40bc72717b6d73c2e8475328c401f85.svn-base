1 - Open either sketch on your Arduino IDE:
	- mbslave_pde_example.pde is programed in C. The complete modbus implementation is inside the sketch. Nothing else is needed.
	- mbslave_lib_example.pde uses the ModbusSlave library. The library is included in this directory as the directory ModbusSlave. See Arduino 		  library reference on the internet to see how to install the library. 
	
2 - upload your selected sketch into your arduino.

3 - on your linux console, change to the directory where you unpacked mbslave_examples.tar.gz file, and type:
make
this will create the Modbus master file mbm. 

4 - Run the executable:
./mbm

You will see the led of your arduino turn off (if it was on), then turn on
for 2 seconds, then blink quite fast for 3 secs, and then blink slower for
6 seconds.

You can of course use other Modbus master implementations for your test.
